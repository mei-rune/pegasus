Updated project website and documentation.

23/01/2011 nick_wagner@users.sourceforge.net
My win32 change gave a warning I didn't like on OSX, so I changed it slightly
Removed two items that were causing warnings on windows, and fixed a crash when the database is removing a service.

22/02/2011 c_varun@users.sourceforge.net
slptool did not support dynamic registration with desired age field. This means registrations done using slptool would expire in default time 3 hours. This patch adds an optional switch to pass age parameter to fix the problem. If no options are specified then default timeout of 3 hours is taken.

22/02/2011 nick_wagner@users.sourceforge.net
Fixed OSX build of thread.c

27/01/2011 c_varun@users.sourceforge.net
The script fixes muticast issues when no address are set.
The Problem was found and fixed by Pete Zannucci.
I just came across a problem with the current version of openslp.  It appears that the watchPID and Ager (slpd_database.c) code can leak memory and file descriptors. 
Could you check the latest code and see if the following has been addressed?  These two changes need to be done in slpd_database.c otherwise the sfcbd process will keep allocating more fd's.

BUG: (Fixed)
REMOVE the incoming service and sockets, not just the database entry

23/12/2010 rim-tus@users.sourceforge.net
Update courtesy of Roel van de Kraats to make recursive mutexes work in the absence of __USE_UNIX98.

22/12/2010 rim-tus@users.sourceforge.net
Fix for a problem I saw when an attribute started with an escaped reserved character such as '(' (\28) - the daemon crashed.
Problem with parsing for OPAQUE values - parser gets confused between OPAQUE values and strings starting
with an escaped character, and thinks they're malformed OPAQUE values.  Also, the parser was expecting an OPAQUE
value to start with "\00", but the RFC says they should start with "\FF".

29/11/2010 nick_wagner@users.sourceforge.net
Exposed -p to --help parameter

24/11/2010 rkraats@users.sourceforge.net
Fixed some missing EOLs in DEBUG output.
Make sure config.h is included everywhere by including it through slpd.h.
Implemented SLPDIncomingSocketDump() and SLPDOutgoingSocketDump().

15/11/2010 rkraats@users.sourceforge.net
Added a boolean configuration option 'net.slp.useDHCP' (default 'true') to
optionally disable using DHCP for DA and/or scope discovery.

11/11/2010 rkraats@users.sourceforge.net
Fixed memory leak in SLPIfaceParseProc, introduced in r1646.
Renamed SLPIfaceParseProc to SLPIfaceGetV6Addr, since it no longer uses /proc.
Check for overflow of iface_count.
Fixed compiler warning on unused 'fd'. 

18/10/2010 c_varun@users.sourceforge.net
This fixes a memory leak in slpd.

Note from patch submitter: Pete
There has been no growth since starting slpd.  The fix appears to have corrected the leak.The pointer would need to be added to pNormalisedSrvtype would need to be
either freed before leaving the Register call (if not stored indexed) or cleaned up by the Deregistration.  The patch adds it to the structure to allow pNormalisedSrvtype to be freed in a consistent manner (whether indexed or
non-indexed storage database storage is done) by the Deregistration code.

07/10/2010 jcalcote@users.sourceforge.net
A better way of doing the circular extension check - thanks to Michael Schroeder.

06/10/2010 jcalcote@users.sourceforge.net
Add an endless loop check to the extension parser for v2 messages.

04/10/2010 c_varun@users.sourceforge.net
Major changes to include optional % parameters for slpd daemon to bind on ipv6 address. Further details are found in http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=3040496&group_id=1730&atid=101730

03/10/2010 c_varun@users.sourceforge.net
Fixing the bug #1958388
Typo in code. Based on bug #2982506

08/09/2010 nick_wagner@users.sourceforge.net
Committed slptool_lib.patch submitted by Varun_C to fix an slptool IPv6 issue.  With multiple NICs, each bound to a different localhost address, slptool was having difficulty connecting to a server on the non-dominant interface.

01/09/2010 nick_wagner@users.sourceforge.net
Made changes so Visual studio express 2005 would build openslp again.

31/08/2010 nick_wagner@users.sourceforge.net
Added slp_network.c to libcommonslpd
Added patch SLPRegPatchAug24 by Varun Chandramohan -- see the openslp.devel archives.  It allows MTU to be greater than 1400 bytes.

23/08/2010 jcalcote@users.sourceforge.net
Convert from use of __USE_UNIX98 to AC_USE_SYSTEM_EXTENSIONS. Fixed one warning.
Ensure null scope list in SLPFindSrvs can't cause a crash.
Added recursion to posix mutexs; added lock around sighup call in properties.

12/08/2010 nick_wagner@users.sourceforge.net
Tweaked the darwin change again -- the linked list solution wasn't working well in all cases.  At least the socket allocation isn't forced on all platforms.
made the last fix to slpd_incoming.c Darwin only
slpd_incoming.c IncomingDatagramRead() now chooses a unicast socket to send over if the receiving socket was listening to multicast.  This fixes a bug on Snow Leopard, where those sendto's were failing with errno 49.

16/07/2010 rim-tus@users.sourceforge.net
Update the slp.conf file comment to reflect the current protocol defaults correctly  ie. IPv4 enabled and IPv6 disabled, and correct the incorrect case in the commented-out directives.
Incorporate the conditional compilation of the code to switch to the "daemon" user. Taken from (part of) Matt Pendlebury's patch in bug report #3026763

15/07/2010 rim-tus@users.sourceforge.net
Fix compile error when SLPv2 security is enabled, as reported in bug #2983069
Applied Anthony Tong's IPv6 patch from his forum posting in http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_name=487B7A7B.7070308%40TrustedCS.com&forum_name=openslp-devel
after discussion with Varun Chandramohan

10/05/2010 rim-tus@users.sourceforge.net
Oops. Correct bug introduced in indexing updates that caused segfault when registering with no attributes

19/04/2010 rim-tus@users.sourceforge.net
Just an update to the ChangeLog with the major Thales-submitted changes

15/03/2010 richard.morrell@uk.thalesgroup.com
Update to introduce indexing of service types and attributes to improve search
performance when the daemon has a large number (hundreds) of services.
Indexing is optional, and controlled by the configuration file.
Predicate searching has been refactored to pre-parse the predicate and the
attributes, so even non-indexed searches should see a speed-up.

24/09/2008 richard.morrell@uk.thalesgroup.com
Add an option to the slp.conf file whereby all DAs can be configured to
regularly broadcast their presence (DA Advert) at a settable rate (dependent
on the daemon's timer interval), and all DAs & SAs so configured will monitor
the broadcasts, and remove a DA from the list of known DAs if three
consecutive broadcasts are missed.

24/09/2008 richard.morrell@uk.thalesgroup.com
Implement "multi-unicast" for IPv4 - find a spanning list of DAs that,
together, support all the scopes, and search all of them by unicast in
parallel.

*** TAG OpenSLP-1.3.0 ***
03/02/2004 beastham@emware.com
IPv6 support has been added to OpenSLP.  It is generally transparent to the
API user, but it would be a good idea to look at the conf file additions to
acquaint yourself with the new settings available.

Added fix from Arun Barboza to make V1 DAAdverts use the same encoding as
the request

02/22/02 matt@caldera.com
Added patch from Arun Barboza to handle "==" V1 predicates.  This allows
OpenSLP to be useful in servicing request in Novell NetWare environments.

02/13/02 matt@caldera.com
Added PID monitoring.  Now when the process that called SLPReg() (with
SLP_REG_FLAG_WATCH_PID) dies the registration will automatically be deregistered.

01/25/2002 matt@caldera.com
Added relevant fixes from the stable branch:
   - Applied patch from Garth Bushell that fixes a problem where not enough
     memory was being allocated to hold an escaped string in SLPEscape().

Moved URL parsing code to common code (slp_parse.c) and added a few network
